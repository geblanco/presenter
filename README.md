# presenter

A shell script to scroll all zathura pdf documents at once.

# Keybindings

Keybindings are done following vim, `j/J` scrolls one page down, `k/K` scrolls one page up, `g/G` goes to top or last page.

# Caveats

By now, it works with dbus, in the future synctex should be used.

When documents have different number of pages, the minimum is chosen as the last page to scroll
